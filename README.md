## Data-driven predictive maintenance planning for maritime industry <br>


**Abstract:**<br>
Data-driven prediction of maintenance planning can have a twofold benefit. Both for the
company that provides spare parts for the maintenance and for the customer that has a
maintenance scheduled. In maritime industry in particular, since the customer’s vessels
operate worldwide, scheduling is of even greater importance. When a vessel is under
scheduled maintenance, the parts have to be at the right place at the right time. This
means that when the order for the parts is made, the parts need to be on the shelf, ready
for delivery. Predicting the customer’s demands, assists in inventory management and
reduces the risk of stockouts, from the spare part provider’s perspective. At the same
time, it ensures that the vessel will have the spare parts delivered on time minimizing the
risk for the vessel to stay off-hire, from the vessel-owner’s perspective.<br> <br>
Predicting spare parts demand with classic statistical methods is very challenging due
to non-normal characteristics that spare part demand possesses. In this study, seven
machine learning classification models were tested and evaluated, including a Random
Forest, an XGBoost classifier and a Neural Network. Those three seem to have promising
potential. These methods were improved by optimizing the thresholds, balancing the
weights of the classes and by tuning the hyperparameters.<br> <br>
The Random Forest is the model that achieved the best score, with the Neural Network,
however, being a very good alternative.


**Description:** <br>
1. Using historical data on vessels maintenance to predict maintenance needs for the upcoming year <br>
2. Shape a real-world problem into a Machine Learning Binary classification problem <br>
3. Implement, improve and compare various ML models
